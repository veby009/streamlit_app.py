💻 20+ years of enterprise IT leadership across cloud platforms, cybersecurity frameworks (SOC2, ISO 27001), and digital infrastructure. Passionate about secure-by-design architecture, DevSecOps, and applying machine learning for smarter threat detection.

🔍 Areas of Focus:

Cyber Threat Detection (SIEM, IOC/IOA Analytics)
Infrastructure Monitoring & Automation (Python, Bash)
AI for Security (Unsupervised Learning, Anomaly Detection)
Real-time Alerting & Network Analytics
🔗 Projects here are a blend of my technical expertise and real-world cybersecurity use cases.


# 🛡️ Anomaly Detection in Enterprise Network Traffic  
**Machine Learning & Deep Learning for Threat Detection**

This project leverages both classical and deep learning techniques to detect cyber threats in enterprise-level network traffic data. Inspired by real-world SOC (Security Operations Center) use cases, the system is built using the [UNSW-NB15 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrwellsdavid/unsw-nb15) and includes 3 core notebooks.

## 📊 Dataset: UNSW-NB15
- Simulated enterprise traffic with attacks: Exploits, DoS, Reconnaissance, Backdoor
- Labeled for supervised validation
- Multiple features: duration, bytes, protocol, state, and services

---

## 💡 Why This Project?
As a Senior IT Manager with expertise in infrastructure and cybersecurity, I’ve built this project to:
- Showcase machine learning capabilities for SOC environments
- Demonstrate proactive threat hunting using unsupervised methods
- Blend domain knowledge with Python-based analytics

---

## 🧠 Future Work
- Add supervised ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Streamlit-based monitoring dashboard
- Integrate real-time threat feed (Sigma rules or MITRE TTPs)

# 🛡️ Network Traffic Anomaly Detection – Notebook 1: Data Exploration

In this notebook, we explore the **UNSW-NB15 dataset**, which contains labeled enterprise traffic including both normal activity and various attack types.

## Key Steps:
- Imported the dataset and examined its structure
- Analyzed class imbalance and attack type distribution
- Visualized feature correlation
- Encoded categorical columns and removed irrelevant fields

This clean dataset will now be used to train machine learning models in the next notebook.
